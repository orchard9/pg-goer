# Project Vision

## Core Vision
PG GoER aims to be the simplest, most reliable PostgreSQL documentation generator that developers actually use.

## Design Principles
1. **Zero Friction**: Single command execution with sensible defaults
2. **Always Accurate**: Documentation reflects real database state
3. **Developer First**: Output optimized for developer workflows
4. **Professional Quality**: Enterprise-ready code and documentation
5. **Transparent**: Clear about being AI-written, focused on quality

## Long-term Goals
- Become the go-to tool for PostgreSQL documentation
- Maintain backward compatibility across PostgreSQL versions
- Keep the tool lightweight and dependency-minimal
- Support CI/CD integration for automated documentation
- Remain open source and community-driven

## Non-Goals
- Multi-database support (PostgreSQL only)
- GUI interface (CLI only)
- Real-time monitoring (snapshot documentation only)
- Schema modification capabilities (read-only)
