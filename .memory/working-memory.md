# Working Memory

## Recent Work
- Enhanced UAT process to generate example outputs in multiple formats (markdown and JSON)
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI failures including docker-compose updates and security action references
- Resolved linting issues with hugeParam errors and duplicate code elimination using generic helpers
- Completed comprehensive PostgreSQL documentation with indexes, triggers, extensions, views, and sequences

## Current Work
- Updated UAT script to automatically generate example-output.md and example-output.json during testing
- Modified Makefile to preserve example output files for user reference after UAT completion
- Fixed SQL query generation issues in schema analyzer to properly handle WHERE clauses
- All major features implemented and validated through comprehensive UAT testing

## Future Work
- Consider adding YAML output format support for third output option
- Potential performance optimizations for large database schemas
- Additional PostgreSQL object types (functions, procedures, custom types) if requested
