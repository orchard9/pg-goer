# Working Memory

## Recent Work
- Split UAT commands into reliable, focused components (uat-up, uat-run, uat-down) following core values
- Created focused scripts: wait-for-postgres.sh for database readiness, run-tests.sh for pure testing logic
- Implemented elegant separation of concerns: environment setup, testing, and cleanup as distinct operations

## Current Work
- UAT system now supports both complete cycles and individual steps for development efficiency
- All UAT commands tested and working reliably with proper error handling and status reporting
- Integration test framework completed with comprehensive Docker-based validation

## Future Work
- Add Docker-based integration testing framework for continuous validation
- Implement JSON output format as alternative to markdown
- Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated testing and releases
