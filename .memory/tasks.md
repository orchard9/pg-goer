# Project Tasks

## Pending Tasks

### 16. Add integration test with Docker PostgreSQL
Set up Docker-based testing against real PostgreSQL instances.
Ensures our tool works with actual databases, not just mocks.

### 17. Add JSON output format
Implement JSON report generation as alternative to markdown.
Enables programmatic consumption of the documentation.

### 18. Set up GitHub Actions CI
Configure automated testing and building on every push.
Maintains quality and provides pre-built binaries.

### 19. Verify GitHub Actions workflow
Push changes and confirm GitHub Actions runs successfully.
Critical to ensure CI pipeline works before depending on it for quality gates.

### 20. Create release process in Makefile
Add make release target for creating versioned binaries.
Automates the release process for consistency.

### 21. Build and test final binary
Final validation of the complete tool with all features.
Ensure single binary works as designed with no dependencies.
